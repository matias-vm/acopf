This directory entails 3 subdirectories which contain scripts
and all the necessary data to replicate our computational experiments
in Section 7 of our paper:

D. Bienstock, and M. Villagra, Accurate Linear Cutting-Plane Relaxations for ACOPF, arXiv:2312.04251v3, 2024

'ampl_acopf': single and multi-time period ACOPF and the SOCP
relaxations described in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.5.

'cutplane': single and multi-time period cutting-plane algorithm
described in Section 5.

'dcopf': multi-time period DCOPF in Section 7.3.2.
